        <item>\"What is about your elf?\", \"Shave your mustaches!\", \"Wash your hair!\", \"Geeks will happen in the best regulated families!\". You do not like hearing this all the time, right? Do not worry, because you are great defender of Azeroth!</item>
        <item>Wanna some beer? Oh, how nice to live alone. Only this eternal cleaning… Bhee… It seems to be a time to find housewife. Think about this!</item>
        <item>You seem to say often: \"This is art!\" Do not be in mainstream. Show others your individuality. Do not look at haters, because haters gonna hate.</item>
        <item>Exams are coming! Do not forget to pay for the mobile internet, questions would not google themselves and spurs would not download themselves too. Snout in the shoe, do not wash the head, scream for the luck and run for a freebie off!</item>
        <item>It is time to join another adventure. Nothing to do at home. Do not forget sleeping bag and compass. Sleeping bag you can sell to somebody when you get lost and find a camp of savages who worship sleeping bag, or you totally will lose any hope. Compass will help you to find nearest dealer. Be careful with whitewalkers!</item>
        <item>We do not need tyans? Over 300 hours of anime at myshows? Yeap, you are looking like a successful man… Did not you think you are doing something wrong?</item>
        <item>HLS! Alexandrus Nevscus! How much do you reaping from the chest? Hundred? Two? Do guys from your ghetto chase you? Call us may be, if they are! We will drive to you by out low Fords and we will solve all your problems!</item>
        <item>Let it rock. America, Hollywood, nacked women! Freddy will be always in our hearts! We are the champions!</item>
        <item>Be careful with your pets. Love them. Buy them some \"candies\", because they love this and they will worship you!</item>
        <item>Surely, you are always hanging out there. We hope your posts will always be in hot. We wish you boobs, cats and candies.</item>
